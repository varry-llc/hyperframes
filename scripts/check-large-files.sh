# Reject large binaries committed straight into the git pack instead of LFS.
#
# Why this exists: the repo's history carries hundreds of MB of binaries that
# should have been LFS — a 31 MB ONNX model, nested HDR-regression MP4s that
# dodged non-recursive .gitattributes globs, demo clips, scratch renders. Each
# was "noticed later and deleted," but a raw commit lives in history forever and
# every clone pays for it. This hook stops the next one at commit time.
#
# Rule: any staged file larger than $MAX_KB that is NOT routed through Git LFS
# fails the commit. Fix by either adding an LFS pattern in .gitattributes for
# that path/extension, or not committing the file (assets/, gitignore, etc.).
#
# Usage:
#   check-large-files.sh                 # default: check the staged file set
#   check-large-files.sh <file> [<file>] # explicit files (handy for testing)
#   check-large-files.sh --range <base> <head>  # files a commit range adds or changes (CI)
#
# The staged and range modes size the blob git stores, not the file on disk, so
# a file matching an LFS pattern but added without git-lfs installed is caught.
#
# We read the staged set ourselves rather than taking lefthook's {staged_files}
# expansion, which splits paths containing spaces into separate args.
