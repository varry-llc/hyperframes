/**
 * Generate Catalog Preview Payloads
 *
 * Writes each catalog item's compiled composition to
 * `docs/public/catalog/<type>/<name>.json` so the docs site can mount it in a
 * live `<hyperframes-player>` instead of an uploaded MP4.
 *
 * Why JSON and not the composition HTML itself: the docs host publishes only
 * JSON and image files out of `docs/public`. `.html`, `.js` and `.css` are
 * dropped from the build with no error, so a preview shipped as an HTML file
 * 404s in production while its page still serves. The player takes the
 * composition as a `srcdoc` string, so JSON is the delivery format that both
 * survives the deploy and matches what the player wants.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-catalog-payloads.ts                    # all items
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-catalog-payloads.ts --only data-chart  # single item
 *   npx tsx scripts/generate-catalog-payloads.ts --type block       # blocks only
