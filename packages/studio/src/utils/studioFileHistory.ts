   * What a path holds ON DISK right now, when that is not the same as the
   * history's "before".
   *
   * The two are normally one value, so the write's optimistic-concurrency
   * expectation was taken straight from the undo baseline. They come apart when
   * a server-side mutation has already written part of the edit: deleting a clip
   * POSTs `remove-element`, which rewrites the file, and only then saves the
   * duration shrink — expecting the pre-delete content it read at the start. The
   * server had moved the file on, so the write was refused as a conflict, the
   * save queue paused, and the clip stayed on the timeline until a reload.
   *
   * Undo still restores `before`; this only says what to expect on disk.
